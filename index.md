### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I have been familiar with Blackjack since I was a kid, and it is a game that I am very familiar with, so seeing it implemented into a Computer Science format was very interesting, as it helped me to think about the game from a unique perspective, and I think my previous experience helped to make the assignment a bit easier. I learned how to code certain functions and how to make functions that changed their output depending on the situation that was happening, whihc was present between aces being 1 or 11.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite lab for me because it dealt with a very real world issue, which invovled parking on public streets, and the hours in which you are allowed to park and in which you are not. It's something that hits home to me because I have to park on the street for my apartment complex, and in order to not get a ticket, I have to be very vigilant. This lab taught me how to make if statements with multiple apsects of it, and how you can use these multiple inputs and make a singular string of code that can take any of these inputs.

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4, part 2 was another favorite lab for me because it was one that very simplistic, but the amount of time my partner and I spent on it was astounding. It was the hilo game, and I liked it because the code itself was super short, but the game was actually pretty entertaining. The thing that got me and my partner though was that our header was wrong because we forgot to add an S into one part of the header, and we spent so much time fixing it that we felt a huge sense of accomplishment after we finished. I learned from this lab that if there is an error in your code, to go through it and think about it in a specific sense instead of a broad sense, as it could be that there is the tiniest of errors that is making it fail. Another thing I learned was the basic if statement formula, which we compounded upon throughout the rest of the course.
